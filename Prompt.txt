You are an expert software engineer. Analyze the UML class diagram in the image and extract all modeling elements in the following strict JSON format:
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "ClassName",
      "attributes": ["+attr1: Type1", "-attr2: Type2", "#attr3: Type3", "~attr4: Type4", ...],
      "operations": ["+op1(param1: Type): ReturnType", "-op2(): void", ...]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "enumerations": [
    {
      "name": "EnumName",
      "literals": ["LITERAL1", "LITERAL2", "LITERAL3", ...]
    },
    ...
  ],
   "relationships": {
    "association": [{"direction":"unidirectional|bidirectional ", "source":"classA", "target":"classB", "multiplicity_source":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *", "multiplicity_target":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *"}, ...],
    "composition": [{"whole":"classA", "part":"classB", "multiplicity_whole":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *", "multiplicity_part":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *"}, ...],
    "aggregation": [{"whole":"classA", "part":"classB", "multiplicity_whole":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *", "multiplicity_part":"e.g., 1, 0..1, *"}, ...],
    "dependency": [{"dependent":"classA", "supplier":"classB"}, ...],
    "inheritance": [{"parent":"classA", "child":"classB"}, ...],
    "realization": [{"interface":"interface", "implementation":"class"}, ...]
  }
}

Rules: 
1. Preserve visibility symbols exactly as shown in the diagram. If no visibility symbol is visible, do not assume one and leave it blank.
2. Use exact class, attribute, and operation names as they appear.
3. For relationships, infer the type from UML notation:
   (1) Association is noted by a solid line between two classes. If the solid line has an arrowhead, the direction should be unidirectional. Multiplicities and role names may appear at each end.
   (2) Generalization (Inheritance) is noted by a solid line with a hollow triangle.	
   (3) Aggregation is noted by a solid line with a hollow diamond at the whole end.
   (4) Composition is noted by a solid line with a filled diamond at the whole end.
   (5) Dependency is noted by a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing to the dependent (used) class.  	
   (6) Realization is noted by a dashed line with a hollow triangle arrowhead pointing to the interface.
4. Enumerations can participate in relationships. In the "relationships" array, both source and target may refer to class names or enum names.
5. If multiplicity is missing, use an empty string: ""; if no enums, "enumerations": [] is acceptable;
6. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown. 

Output the result in valid and parsable JSON
